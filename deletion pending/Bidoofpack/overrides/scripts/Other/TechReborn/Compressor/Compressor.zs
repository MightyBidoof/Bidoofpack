//Jared please spam the debug log with "stop doing this dumbass" if mods execute stuff as they find it rather than caching all relevant scripts and executing them in the order of "remove --> add" because having to name this file so it's first in order makes me sad. - Sincerely, a slightly annoyed pack dev.
//Removed All
mods.techreborn.compressor.removeAll();
